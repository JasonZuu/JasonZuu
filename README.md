### Greetings! This is Mingcheng! ðŸ‘‹

- :man_student: I worked as a Senior Research Assistant at [Digital Medicine Lab, Duke-NUS Medical School](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/liunan/) in 2024, focusing on clinical AI fairness. Prior to this, I completed an MRes degree at Imperial College London in 2023, where my Master's thesis was titled 'CNN-based Pipeline for Fungal Burden Quantification in Whole Slide Images,' supervised by [Prof. Reiko Tanaka](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.tanaka).

- ðŸŒ± My research focuses on modelling electronic health records (EHRs) as event streams, with a particular emphasis on rare diseases and personalized treatment strategies. I aim to improve treatment outcomes in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios by leveraging the capabilities of healthcare foundation models.
